# Wabbajack Lexy Preparator
Automates the first 6 steps of the LexyLOTD Wabbajack Installer at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STYNSTqhaBTgrr4_jAFdWcMbBZWbqb2KdoHJ23RxKec so you have a fully clean install of Skyrim SE.

Some people had some trouble with finding all the directories to delete prior to running Wabbajack, this should ease the pain!
If it finds the directory that is in a step on the guide, it will ask you whether you want to delete it. To be sure, deletions aren't permanent - they just go to the recycle bin, just as you would do regularly.
