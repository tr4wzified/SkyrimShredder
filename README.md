Some people had some trouble with finding all the directories to delete prior to running Wabbajack, this should ease the pain!
If it finds the directory that is in a step on the guide, it will ask you whether you want to delete it. To be sure, deletions aren't permanent - they just go to the recycle bin, just as you would do regularly.
